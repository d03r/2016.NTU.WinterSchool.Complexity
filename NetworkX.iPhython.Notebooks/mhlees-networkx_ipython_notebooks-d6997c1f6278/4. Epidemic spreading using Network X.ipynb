    "# Epidemic spreading using NetworkX\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks, and in particular network simulation, are a key tool in trying to predict the spread of worldwide pandemics. Many governments using modelling and simulation software to help them make decisions during an epidemic outbreak. [Gleamviz](http://www.gleamviz.org) is a nice example of a sophisticated software system that enables policy makers to predict the spread of an epidemic and decide on appropriate intervention strategies. Gleamviz has been used to predict the spread of [H1N1 in 2009](http://www.gleamviz.org/case-study/reports/) and [Ebola in 2014](http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/assessing-the-international-spreading-risk-associated-with-the-2014-west-african-ebola-outbreak/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we will build a simple model of disease spread on different artificial networks and investigate different vacination policies to try and prevent or slow down the spread of the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suceptible, Infected, Removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disease spread can be modelled in various ways using networks, but we will consider a network where nodes represent people and edges between two nodes indicate that those two people have sufficient contact (interaction) such that a disease has a non-zero probability of transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node (person) in the network can be in one of 3 possible states: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Succeptible (the default state) - indicating the person may contract the disease if one of their neighbours has the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Infected - the person currently has the disease and can infect their neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Removed - the person has either recovered from the disease and is no longer infectious (and cannot contract the disease again) or the person has died.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIR is applicable in many real world diseases, e.g., HiV, Chicken Pox, etc. The following system of differential equations can be used to describe the SIR model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{ds}{dt} = -\\beta i(t) s(t)\n",
    "\\hspace{1in}\n",
    "\\frac{di}{dt} = \\beta i(t) s(t) - \\alpha i(t)\n",
    "\\hspace{1in}\n",
    "\\frac{dr}{dt} = \\alpha i(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ describe the rate of removal (fraction of people moving from infected to removed per time unit) and the rate of infection (fraction of people moving from succeptible to infected per time unit).\n",
    "In the above model the assumption is of a well mixed population, i.e., every person has a chance of infecting every other person. In many real world scenarios this assumption is too strong, the reality is that people only interact within their social circle. They will only contract and transmit the disease from and to people with whom they make contact. It is therefore interesting to try and understand how the network strucutre impacts the spread, or how it might enable effective vacination strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our network-based model each infected node has a probability of transmitting the disease to **each** of their immediate neighbours with probability $\\beta$ each time step. Infected nodes also have a probability of recovering from the disease at each time step, with probabiltiy $\\alpha$. So for an infected node $n_i$ with degree $k_i$, if $\\alpha = \\beta = 1$, $n_i$ will infect all $k_i$ neighbours, and then move to the removed state, all within a single time step.\n",

We also always start the initial infection with the same number of individuals\n",

    "The only initial condition that changes in the current experiments is the set of nodes that we initially infect. This set (althgouh of fixed size) is chosen randomly inside the **initialise_infection** function, this is done with the command **random.sample**. If that initial random sample of people from the graph just so happens to hit one important node (highly connected) the likliehood of an outbreak occuring is high. However, if the sample only contains nodes with very low degree (e.g., 1), then there is good chance that those node will be removed (moved to state R) before they have chance to infect other nodes (obviously this depends on the disease and the values of $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$)\n",

For example, they may have some idea about the network structure, but not all, they may also have an approximation (or range) for $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$, through data collected at hospitals. However, they will almost never have all the information necessary to make a prediction. In this case it's necessary to assess the sensitivity of the results according to each unknown (and perhaps known) parameter."
